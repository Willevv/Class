# Classification project to classify 'Jorg', 'Bob' or 'Atsuto'
The Training was done on the file 'TrainOnMe-4.csv' and the evaluation on 'EvaluateOnMe-4.csv'
I used Gradient boost classifier and the work also included cleaning up the data from missing values NaNs datatype errors etc. 

Achieved accuracy on the real classes found in 'EvaluationGT-4.csv' was 75%
